## **How to Set Up the Virtual Environment**

This project is designed to run in an isolated Python virtual environment to ensure dependency management and reproducibility. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python (3.8 or higher recommended)**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. Check the version:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - In the project root directory, create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required packages using `requirements.txt` (if provided):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   - Ensure all necessary packages are installed:
     ```bash
     pip list
     ```

6. **Deactivate Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   - Exit the virtual environment when done:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```
